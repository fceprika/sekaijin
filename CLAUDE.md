# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Sekaijin** (世界人 - "citoyen du monde" en japonais) is a Laravel-based community platform for French expatriates worldwide. The application provides a space for French expats to connect, share experiences, and access resources specific to their needs abroad.

## Core Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Laravel 10.x (PHP 8.1+)
- **Frontend**: Blade templates with Tailwind CSS v3 and jQuery
- **Database**: MySQL with custom expat-focused user fields
- **Build Tools**: Vite for asset compilation
- **Authentication**: Custom Laravel authentication system

### Key Components

**Database Schema Extensions**:
The User model has been extended beyond standard Laravel auth to include expat-specific fields:
- Required fields: `name` (pseudo), `email`, `country_residence`
- Optional personal info: `first_name`, `last_name`, `birth_date`, `phone` (nullable)
- Location data: `country_residence` (required), `city_residence` (optional)
- Community features: `bio`, `is_verified`, `last_login`, `is_public_profile`
- Role system: `role` field with 4 levels (free, premium, ambassador, admin)

**Authentication Flow**:
- Custom AuthController handles simplified registration/login
- French-language forms at `/inscription` and `/connexion` routes
- Simplified registration requiring only pseudo, email, country of residence, and password
- Complete country list (195 countries) organized by continent

**View Architecture**:
- Base template: `resources/views/layout.blade.php` with responsive navigation, direct country links, and profile integration
- Homepage: `resources/views/home.blade.php` with dynamic 2x2 grid layout displaying real content from Thailand and Japan
- HomeController: `app/Http/Controllers/HomeController.php` provides real database data instead of dummy content
- Main pages: home, about, services, contact (all French-localized)
- Auth views: `resources/views/auth/` directory with custom styling
- Profile management: `resources/views/profile/show.blade.php` for user profile editing
- Reusable components: `resources/views/partials/countries.blade.php` for country selection
- Consistent Tailwind CSS theming with blue/purple gradients

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow Rules
**IMPORTANT: Claude Code must follow these Git rules at all times:**

- **NEVER push directly to main branch** - Always create feature branches
- **Branch naming convention**: `feature/description-of-feature` or `fix/bug-description`
- **Always create Pull Requests** for code review before merging to main
- **Only push to main** after explicit user approval and instruction
- **Commit messages**: Use conventional commits format with appropriate emojis
- **Work in isolation**: Each feature/fix should be in its own branch

**Workflow steps:**
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/feature-name`
2. Make changes and commit with descriptive messages
3. Push to feature branch: `git push origin feature/feature-name`
4. Create PR for review (use `gh pr create` command)
5. Wait for user approval before merging to main

### Local Development Setup
**IMPORTANT: DO NOT start the Laravel server - it is already running**

The development environment is already configured and running:
- Laravel backend is running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 
- Vite frontend assets can be started with `npm run dev` if needed

**Claude Code should NEVER run `php artisan serve` or attempt to start the Laravel server**

### Database Operations
```bash
# Run migrations (includes custom expat fields)
php artisan migrate

# Create new migration
php artisan make:migration migration_name

# Database name: sekaijin
# Connection: MySQL on localhost:3306, user: root, no password
```

### Asset Compilation
```bash
# Development (with hot reload)
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run PHPUnit tests
php artisan test
# or
./vendor/bin/phpunit

# Run specific test
php artisan test --filter TestClassName
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Laravel Pint (code formatting)
./vendor/bin/pint

# Run with specific configuration
./vendor/bin/pint --config=pint.json
```

## Application-Specific Context

### French Localization
- All user-facing content is in French
- Route names use French terms (`/inscription`, `/connexion`, `/deconnexion`)
- Error messages and validation text localized for French expat audience
- Navigation: Direct country links (Thailand, Japan), À propos, Contact, with dynamic country-specific menus when browsing country sections

### Expat-Focused Features
- Complete country selection (195 countries) organized by continent in registration and profile
- Comprehensive user profile management system at `/profil` for authenticated users
- User profiles designed around expat needs (residence country/city tracking, bio, personal info)
- Secure profile editing with password change functionality
- Community stats display (25K+ members, 150 countries, etc.)

### Authentication Security
- Password minimum 8 characters with confirmation
- Email uniqueness validation
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Terms acceptance required for registration
- Automatic login after successful registration

### Frontend Integration
- jQuery globally available via `window.$` and `window.jQuery`
- Tailwind CSS v3 with custom configuration
- Vite handles asset bundling and hot module replacement
- Custom CSS in `resources/css/app.css` loads Tailwind directives

## Configuration

### Database Configuration

The application uses a MySQL database named `sekaijin`. The User model includes these custom fields for the expat community:

```php
// Required fields for registration and profile
'name', 'email', 'country_residence', 'password'

// Optional fields (nullable) for enhanced profile
'first_name', 'last_name', 'birth_date', 'phone',
'city_residence', 'destination_country', 'bio', 'youtube_username', 'is_verified', 'last_login', 'role'
```

### Environment Configuration

Add these variables to your `.env` file:

```bash

MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_mapbox_access_token_here
```

The Mapbox token is configured in `config/services.php` and used in the interactive map on the homepage.
